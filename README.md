### Add your photo

Place your profile photo at `assets/photo.jpg`. The site expects a square image (JPEG or PNG). Typical source size: 800×800px.

Note: this build displays a very small hero thumbnail by your request — `32×32` on laptop/desktop and `8×8` on mobile. If you'd rather use larger sizes, tell me which dimensions and I'll update the CSS.

If you want me to add the image file for you, upload it here or place it in the `assets/` folder and I'll wire it in.
```

## How to View

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Customization

- Update personal information in `index.html`
- Modify styles in `css/style.css`
- Adjust functionality in `js/script.js`
- Replace placeholder links with your actual social media and project URLs
